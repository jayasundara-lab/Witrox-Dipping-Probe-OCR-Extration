# Witrox-Dipping-Probe-OCR-Extration
For generating slopes in OCR data

Steps to use

1. Open an Rproject using Rstudio on your computer
2. Copy all data files for analysis into that folder. The script uses the data file name "mytable", so whichever file you're currently working with title "mytable". When you're finished with that file, change the name back to whatever naming schematic you use.
3. Run the script
4. The plot generated will be automatically saved into your Rproject. Copy the plot into whatever organization you have on your desktop and rename (typically I organize by the date the file was read, the family/group you're measuring, and whatever number in that group you're on).
5. Continue analyzing your probe files until you have an image for each of them, remembering to rename as neccessary.
6. Save the slopes into an excel file, remembering to convert from mg/L/second to mg/hr/embryo (instructions in script).
